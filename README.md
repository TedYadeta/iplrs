I) - Definition
===============

  The Interlingual Programming Language Roundtable Scale is an experimental standard I am developing for determining the basic competency of any given individual with a programming language. (I should emphasize here, dear reader, that for programming language, I have an extremely broad definition, that would count scripting languages, and domain-specific languages where applicable.)


II) - Purpose
=============

  The main objective is twofold:

    1. To be briefly introduced to the underlying constructs of the language and understand it as best as possible.

    2. To quickly perform several exercises where you should hopefully gain a fair level of comfort and expertise with the language.

III) - Scale
============

  The Interlingual Programming Language Roundtable Scale was based off of the Interagency Language Roundtable Scale (ILR Scale). It was created by the United States Foreign Department has a standard for testing the competency of a speaker's language. The scale went as follows:

    ILR Level 0 - No Proficiency

    ILR Level 1 - Elementary Proficiency

    ILR Level 2 - Limited Working Proficiency
    
    ILR Level 3 - Professional Working Proficiency

    ILR Level 4 - Full Professional Proficiency

  There are also gradients that exist between each level, such as 0+, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+, but the full definitions of those gradients are outside the scale of this endeavour at this point in time.

  Obviously, as a spoken language and a programming language serve very different goals and employ very different conventions, we must consider carefully as to what each scale should request of its student.

  Right now, the current IPLRS Standard (v.0.1.0) and its Designations with the respective exercises are as follows:

    IPLR Level 0 - Hello World

    IPLR Level 1 - Fizzbuzz

    IPLR Level 2 - Fibonacci (Iterative)

    IPLR Level 3 - Fibonacci (Recursive)

    IPLR Level 4 - Language-Specific Knowledge

IV) - Examples
==============

  To see this scale at work, I have decided to implement these in three languages: Bash, Python and C. While they are not finished yet, my hope is to implement in each of these, as well as update and change the scale, where I can.
